**Motivation**

The motivation behind creating a Python computer vision model for emotion detection stemmed from the desire to provide companies with a valuable tool for enhancing various aspects of their operations, particularly during business meetings. By integrating this model, companies can effortlessly record video footage or enable live emotion detection during meetings, allowing them to gauge the overall mood and sentiment. This capability is invaluable for managers, as they can accurately assess the success of meetings based on the emotions detected. For instance, if clients exhibit signs of happiness, it indicates a positive outcome, whereas expressions of dissatisfaction may indicate areas for improvement. Additionally, managers can leverage the model to evaluate the performance of their team members, such as interns or analysts, by analyzing their emotional responses during interactions. Furthermore, companies can extend the utility of the model by integrating it into their existing CCTV systems, enabling real-time emotion detection among employees throughout the workday. Overall, this computer vision model serves as a versatile tool for enhancing decision-making processes, fostering better communication, and optimizing overall workplace dynamics.
